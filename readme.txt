# Backdoor Project

## Project Overview

This project is designed to perform basic backdoor functionalities on a target machine. It allows for various operations such as:

- **Accessing**: Gaining access to the victim's machine.
- **Manipulating**: Modifying or controlling files and processes on the victim's machine.
- **Modifying**: Changing system configurations or files.
- **Downloading**: Retrieving files from the victim's machine.
- **Uploading**: Sending files to the victim's machine.
- **Encrypting/Decrypting**: Securely encrypting and decrypting files using various encryption techniques.

The backdoor malware is deployed on the victim's machine, while the listener code runs on the attacker's machine, allowing for seamless remote control without the victim's awareness.
